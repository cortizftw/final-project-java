### Java- MySQL Database Tool

### Project Description

The objective is to develop a Java console program tailored for managing staff information stored in a MySQL database. 

This program will encompass various functionalities to facilitate seamless data manipulation. 

Firstly, the 'View' option enables users to retrieve and display a specific staff record based on the provided ID, returning a Staff object. 

Additionally, the 'View All' option presents all staff records in ascending order of age, achieved without utilizing SQL ORDER BY but by sorting the collection programmatically.

Moreover, the program features an 'Insert' option, allowing users to add new staff records while implementing a preventive measure to disallow insertion of records with identical first names, last names, and ages. 

For updating existing records, the 'Update' option provides users with the ability to modify information for a specified ID. 

Finally, the 'Delete' option enables users to remove staff records based on the provided ID. Through these functionalities, the Java console program aims to streamline staff information management tasks, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in database operations.
